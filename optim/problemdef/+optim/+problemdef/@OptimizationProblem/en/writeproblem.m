%WRITEPROBLEM Write an OptimizationProblem to file
%
%   writeproblem(PROB) writes a mathematical form of the
%   OptimizationProblem to a text file. The file name is the workspace name
%   of the OptimizationProblem PROB, appended with '.txt'. If writeproblem
%   cannot construct the file name from the input problem, it writes to the
%   file 'WriteProblemOutput.txt'. writeproblem overwrites any existing
%   file.
%
%   writeproblem(PROB, FILENAME) writes a mathematical form of the
%   OptimizationProblem in the specified file.
